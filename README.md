## 📝 **PROMPT RESPONSE:**

Once upon a time, high in a big, old oak tree, lived a little bat named **Bartholomew**. But Bartholomew wasn't like the other bats. While they loved to swoop and soar in the velvety night sky, Bartholomew was **terribly afraid of the dark**.

Every evening, when the sun dipped below the horizon, Bartholomew would shiver in his sleep. His bat friends, **Beatrice** and **Barnaby**, would try to coax him out.  
*"Come on, Bartholomew! The moon is a big, shiny coin tonight!"* Beatrice would say.  
But Bartholomew would just tuck his wings in tighter and whisper, *"I'm too sleepy."*

One night, a wise old owl named **Ollie** flew by. He saw Bartholomew all curled up and asked,  
*"Why aren't you playing with your friends, little one?"*  
Bartholomew confessed his fear. *"I'm afraid of what I can't see,"* he squeaked.

Ollie the owl hooted softly. *"The dark isn't empty, Bartholomew. It's full of hidden wonders! It’s where the fireflies dance, where the crickets sing their sleepy songs, and where the moonbeams turn the dewdrops into tiny stars."*

Bartholomew listened, his ears twitching. Ollie continued,  
*"Your friends are out there too, and they’re not afraid because they have each other. And you, little bat, have something special to light your way."*

*"What is it?"* Bartholomew asked, his voice barely a whisper.

*"Your own bat sonar!"* Ollie said. *"It's like a special sound light. When you make a little clicking noise, it bounces off everything around you and tells you exactly what's there. You're never truly in the dark, Bartholomew, because you carry your own light with you."*

That night, Bartholomew took a deep breath. He made a little *"click, click"* sound. He heard the sound bounce back.  
He did it again, a little louder this time. *Click! Click! Click!*  
He could "see" the leaves of his tree, the branches he was clinging to, and the space just beyond.

He saw that the dark wasn’t an empty blackness at all, but a **beautiful, buzzing world** waiting for him to explore.

He untucked his wings, took a leap, and flew out into the night. His friends, **Beatrice** and **Barnaby**, cheered and joined him.

As he soared under the big, shiny moon, Bartholomew realized that the dark wasn’t something to be afraid of.  
It was just a **different kind of light**, and he had his own special way of seeing it.

From that day on, **Bartholomew the bat was no longer afraid of the dark**, for he knew that the night was full of friendly sounds and hidden wonders—  
and he was a part of it all.
